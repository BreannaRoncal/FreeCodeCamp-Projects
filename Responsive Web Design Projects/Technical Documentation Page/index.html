          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

        <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
          <ul>
            <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
            <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
            <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

        <header class="section-title">JavaScript and Java</header>
        <div class="section-info">

          <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
          <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
          <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header class="section-title">Hello World</header>
        <div class="section-info">
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code: </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
          function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code></pre>
      </div>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Variables_and_Constants">
        <header class="section-title">Variables and Constants</header>
        <div class="section-info">

          <p> You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name. </p>
            <pre>
              <code>
                var x = 42.</code></pre>
                <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters. A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
                <pre>
                  <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                </pre>

        <header class="section-title">Data Types</header>
        <div class="section-info">

          <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.</p>

          <header class="section-title">if... else statement</header>
          <div class="section-info">

            <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows: </p>
            <pre>
              <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
            </pre>

      <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header class="section-title">while statement</header>
        <div class="section-info">

          <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: </p>
          <pre>
            <code>while (condition) statement</code>
          </pre>

        <header class="section-title">Function Declaration</header>
        <div class="section-info">

          <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by: 
            <ul>
              <li>The name of the function</li>
              <li>A list of the arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
              <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {}</li>
            </ul>
            For example, the following code defines a simple function named square: 
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
