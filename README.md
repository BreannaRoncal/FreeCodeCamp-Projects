Completed projects for Free Code Camp

Free Code Camp is a free platform to learn and practice different types of programming.
Once all the projects are completed, I can submit the 5 required projects in order to 
recieve a certificate that states that I completed the course for Responsive Web Design.

In this folder are my completed projects for Responsive Web Design.
The languages I used are HTML5 and CSS.
